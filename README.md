# Simple cli program on Rust

Simple project that covers all basic Rust ideas and concepts and also exploring more standard library features.

This application is a version of the classic command line tool grep (globally search a regular expression and print). In the simplest use case, grep searches a specified file for a specified string. To do so, grep takes as its arguments a filename and a string. Then it reads the file, finds lines in that file that contain the string argument, and prints those lines.

This project combines next number of concepts:

- Organizing code
- Using vectors and strings
- Handling errors
- Using traits and lifetimes where appropriate
- Writing tests
